## Question

So i made a small game using pygame, and I want to be able to give it out to some friends who don't have python, so I want to make it into an EXE. i've been trying for several hours using several different methods, but nothings seems to be working. I would REALLY appreciate any help.

So after all this time I think py2exe appears to be the best tool to use. I have it installed, I just can't get it to work correctly on my game. After looking for many different setup.py file thingys, this is the one i've been using most recently:

    try:
        from distutils.core import setup
        import py2exe, pygame
        from modulefinder import Module
        import glob, fnmatch
        import sys, os, shutil
    except ImportError, message:
        raise SystemExit,  "Unable to load module. %s" % message

    class pygame2exe(py2exe.build_exe.py2exe): #This hack make sure that pygame default font is copied: no need to modify code for specifying default font
        def copy_extensions(self, extensions):
            #Get pygame default font
            pygamedir = os.path.split(pygame.base.__file__)[0]
            pygame_default_font = os.path.join(pygamedir, pygame.font.get_default_font())

            #Add font to list of extension to be copied
            extensions.append(Module("pygame.font", pygame_default_font))
            py2exe.build_exe.py2exe.copy_extensions(self, extensions)

    class BuildExe:
        def __init__(self):
            #Name of starting .py
            self.script = "game.py"

            #Name of program
            self.project_name = "MyApps"

            #Project url
            self.project_url = "about:none"

            #Version of program
            self.project_version = "0.0"

            #License of the program
            self.license = "MyApps License"

            #Auhor of program
            self.author_name = "Me"
            self.author_email = "example@example.com"
            self.copyright = "Copyright (c) 2009 Me."

            #Description
            self.project_description = "MyApps Description"

            #Icon file (None will use pygame default icon)
            self.icon_file = None

            #Extra files/dirs copied to game
            self.extra_datas = ['background.mid','background.png','bonus.png','cowbell.wav','highscore.txt']

            #Extra/excludes python modules
            self.extra_modules = []
            self.exclude_modules = []

            #DLL Excludes
            self.exclude_dll = ['']

            #Zip file name (None will bundle files in exe instead of zip file)
            self.zipfile_name = None

            #Dist directory
            self.dist_dir ='dist'

When I try this however, I get the error:

NotImplementedError: font module not available

(ImportError: MemoryLoadLibrary failed loading pygame\font.pyd)


In my actual code, I'm loading font using:

font = pygame.font.SysFont("freesansbold", 48)


as I heard this is the better way to do it.

I've tried many different setup.py files, but each gives me a different error, whether it be missing DLL's, or font, or something else. If I could get any help with this, i would appreciate it.

Just a small update:

I went through my code and removed all instances of font. Now I get this:

(ImportError: MemoryLoadLibrary failed loading pygame\mixer.pyd)

and I went through and removed every instance of using sounds/mixer, and now it works. The problem is, I kinda need text and sound. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate it. It's probably just something small or stupid

Pygame and py2exe don't get along well, you have to do a few things to get it working. Take a look: http://www.moviepartners.com/blog/2009/03/20/making-py2exe-play-nice-with-pygame/

A great idea is to make a list of the modules you need.

I've tried that site and everything it suggests already, but it hasn't worked.

I realize this's and older thread and is being addressed a few other places, but since it is the result that came up when i googled the exact error message i received, please consider the following: To the best of my knowledge, pygame2exe only works with a slightly older version of python/pygame libraries. I've banged into the exact same brick walls as sinisterduke here, until i uninstalled python 2.6 and reloaded with the following, which are still available somewhere on the respective product's sites.

python-2.5.4.msi

pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.5.msi

py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.5.exe

Good Luck!
